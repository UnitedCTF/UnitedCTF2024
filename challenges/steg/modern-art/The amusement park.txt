In a world where dreams take flight,	      	    	 	   	   
Underneath the vibrant lights,    	 	    	      	    	   
Where laughter dances on the air,  	   	     	     		    
And magic whispers everywhere. 	  	   	  	    	 	 
    	 	   	   	       		     	     	    	 
A place where worries fade away,  	   	       		     	     
In the heart of joy, come out and play,      	     		   	 
The carousel spins round and round,	   	      	    	      	  
With melodies, a charming sound.   	    	     	     	 	    
 		       	  	     	 	 	    	     	  
Cotton candy, sweet delight,
Colors twirl in the soft moonlight,
Roller coasters rise so high,
Touching edges of the sky.

Echoes of the children’s cheer,
Fill the night with endless cheer,
Ferris wheels that kiss the stars,
Beyond the clouds, near and far.

In this realm of fantasy,
Where time stands still, forever free,
An amusement park, a dreamland’s art,
A carnival that warms the heart.
