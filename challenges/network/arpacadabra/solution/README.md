# Solution

Connect with SSH.
Run the python script `solve.py`. This will make a arp poisoning attack which will redirect the request from alice to us. Then we can read the flag.

```bash
sudo python solve.py
```

This challenge was strongly inspired from https://github.com/moospit/net-sec-lab/tree/main.
