GAME_INTRODUCTION = """
Alright, worker, let's get this Cartesian Glide project moving. I've got the numbers, you've got the tools. It's a perfect match, right? Wrong. I'm not handing you the entire blueprint. You're going to have to do some of the heavy lifting here.

I'll provide the X-coordinate, a little taste of what's to come. You figure out the Y. Consider it a trial run before we get to the real engineering challenges. Don't blame me if your coaster ends up being a straight line. Your call.
"""

TIMEOUT_MESSAGE = """
Seriously? You're slower than a snail on ice. Let's try this again. And next time, be faster.
I'm starting to think you're not cut out for this. I'm out.
"""

INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE = """
Numbers, worker. Numbers. Not poetry. Not your life story. Just numbers. Let's try again.
"""

BAD_ANSWER_MESSAGE_WITH_CLUE = """
Are you even trying? That's not even close. The answer was {answer}. I'm starting to regret giving you this easy job.
"""

BAD_ANSWER_MESSAGE_WITHOUT_CLUE = """
Ay, caramba! You are way off. Or maybe not. Who knows? I do off course. The answer was... oh, never mind. I helped you enough already. You need to restart. Bye.
"""

FIRST_CORRECT_ANSWER_MESSAGE = """
Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner! You got it right! That's the first piece of the Cartesian Glide in place. Your reward? A piece of digital confetti - or as we like to call it, a 'flag'. Impressive, huh? But don't let it go to your head. To unlock the next piece of digital confetti, you'll need to string together 10 correct answers. Let's see if you can keep up the streak! Here is your digital confetti: {flag}
"""

CORRECT_ANSWER_MESSAGE = """
Another one in the bag! You're on a roll! Keep it up! Just a few more correct answers to go and we'll be able to construct that roller coaster.
"""

SECOND_CORRECT_ANSWER_MESSAGE = """
You did it! Hundred correct answers in a row? That's incredible! You've officially leveled up from 'worker' to 'roller coaster engineering prodigy'. As a reward for your exceptional performance, here's your second flag - and trust me, this one's the VIP pass to the digital confetti realm. Enjoy the golden shower of recognition! Here is your digital confetti: {flag}
